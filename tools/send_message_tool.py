    authorization did not happen — and returning None there means "authorized",

# NOTE: ``send_message`` is intentionally NOT registered as an agent-callable
# model tool. The agent should not decide on its own to fire off cross-platform
# messages or reactions. The send engine in this module (``_send_to_platform``,
# ``_send_via_adapter``, ``_parse_target_ref``, the per-platform ``_send_*``
# helpers) remains the shared transport used by:
#   - cron delivery (cron/scheduler.py)
#   - the ``hermes send`` CLI command (hermes_cli/send_cmd.py)
#   - the gateway kanban notifier (dashboard-toggled, outside agent control)
#   - the standalone MCP server (mcp_serve.py), which is an opt-in surface
# Those callers import the helpers directly; none of them need the registry
# entry.
